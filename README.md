Computer vision is the science that aims to give a similar, if not better, capability to a machine or computer. Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images.

The repo basically contains quite a few mini projects that shows how computers see and process an image. The number of channels in an image, the feature extraction process etc..
